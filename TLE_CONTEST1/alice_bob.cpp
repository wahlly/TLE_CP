/*
You are given a watermelon of N
 kilograms. You are friends with Alice and Bob, who want you to split the watermelon in two parts. They also want you to maximize the total tastiness of the watermelon.

The tastiness of a watermelon is defined as the sum of the digits of its weight. Can you tell them the maximum tastiness that's possible if you split it optimally?

Input
The only line of input contains an integer n
 (1≤n≤1012)
.

Output
Print the maximum taste of both watermelons combined.

Examples

38
outputCopy
20
Note
We can divide the number 38 into 19, 19 so this gives us the answer [1+9]+[1+9]=20
